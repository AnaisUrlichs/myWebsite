                  <p>I grew up in Germany but had a chance to spend my studies both in the UK and in Spain. 
                    My first undergraduate degree was in Information Management. With an original interest in Cyber Security some friends introduced me to the blockchain space.
                    To fuel my interest I started working as Technical Analyst for an Israeli VC fund while starting a Computer Science Degree.
                    Several years later, after multiple engineering internships and various job experience, I have now found my place as Developer Advocate, 
                    while still working on completing my CS degree.</p>
